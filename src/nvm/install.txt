TEST THAT NVM WAS PROPERLY INSTALLED
To test that nvm was properly installed, close and re-open Terminal and enter nvm. If you get a nvm: command not
found message, your OS may not have the necessary .bash_profile file. In Terminal, enter touch ~/.bash_profile
and run the above install script again.
If you still get nvm: command not found, try the following:
In Terminal, enter nano .bashrc. You should see an export script almost identical to the following:
export NVM_DIR=”/Users/johndoe/.nvm” [ -s “$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh” ] && . “$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh”
Copy the export script and remove it from .bashrc
Save and Close the .bashrc file (CTRL+O – Enter – CTRL+X)
Next, enter nano .bash_profile to open the Bash Profile
Paste the export script you copied into the Bash Profile on a new line
Save and Close the Bash Profile (CTRL+O – Enter – CTRL+X)
Finally enter nano .bashrc to re-open the .bashrc file
Paste the following line into the file:
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
Save and Close (CTRL+O – Enter – CTRL+X)
Restart Terminal and enter nvm to test if it's working
